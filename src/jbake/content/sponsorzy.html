    <strong>Benefits of being Tricity JUG Sponsor</strong>
    <div class="row"></div>
    Thank you for taking interest in supporting us, with that we want to let you know about all benefits that comes with that. Among those
    We’re going to setup your rollup behind the speaker, during our meetings
    On our site and in promotional materials we’re going to put your logo in sponsors section
    While (co)organizing special events, we notify our sponsors and turn to them first. You’re going to know about those before other companies do (lectures on university, conferences, etc).
    When organizing workshops we tend to rely on our sponsors and look for trainers from them, who would be able to lead such events.
    And most of all, we are not commercial group so we limit number of sponsors. We like to keep long term relations, so as long as you want to work with us, we’re going to play fair and will work with you.

    <div class="row"></div>
    Beside those, during one of the meetings sponsor has right to give approximately 10 min talk to introduce his company, tell something about the projects, how people are working, technologies used and such. We are always happy to help with preparing of such presentation to adapt it to the group and make it more effective.
    <div class="row"></div>
    We also never forget about those that were kind to us. If you’ll decide in the future to stop supporting us, we’re going to keep a place for you in friends section, without any additional payments!
    <div class="row"></div>
    All that goodness comes for 4000 PLN +VAT for 12 months. We’re not formal organisation, however we have ability to raise invoice for organizing workshops.
    We want to have limited group of companies that support us, as we’re not working for profits, if we have enough sponsors, then sorry, but you’ll have to wait till someone will decide in stopping actively support us.
